          <h3>Q2) Is there any way to see why some file is getting ignored by git (i.e. which rule in a .gitignore file is causing the file to be ignored)?</h3>
          <h4>Answer 1 </h4>
          <p>git does not currently provide anything like this. But after seeing your question I did some googling and found that back in 2009 this feature was requested and partially implemented. After reading the thread, I realised it would not be too much work to do it properly, so I have started work on a patch and hope to have it finished in the next day or two. I will update this answer when it is ready.</p>
